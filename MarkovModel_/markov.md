**Markov Model for Text Classifier**

In the code MarkovModelForPoems_.ipynb, I used first_order Markov Model for classification problem.

Here is some information of Markov Model and its importance.

<br>
The Markov model for text classification is a statistical approach used to analyze and generate text data. It operates on the principle of Markov chains, where the probability of a word or sequence of words appearing next is determined solely by the preceding words in the text.

**Key Concepts:**
<br>
1. **Markov Chain:** A mathematical concept that describes a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the preceding event.

2. **Transition Probabilities:** In the context of text, these are the probabilities of transitioning from one word to another. These probabilities are calculated based on the frequency of word occurrences in a given text corpus.

3. **Order:** The "order" of a Markov model refers to the number of preceding words considered when predicting the next word. For example, a first-order Markov model considers only the preceding word, while a second-order Markov model considers the preceding two words.


*Usage:*

**Text Generation:** Markov models can be used to generate realistic-looking text by probabilistically predicting the next word in a sequence based on the current word or words.

**Text Classification:** Markov models can be employed as classifiers to determine the likelihood of a given text belonging to a particular category or class.

*Implementation:*

**Training:** The Markov model is trained on a corpus of text data by calculating transition probabilities between words or sequences of words.

**Prediction:** Given a sequence of words, the Markov model predicts the next word based on the highest probability transition from the current sequence.
